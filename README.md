# Crime Hotspot Detection using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on identifying crime hotspots in Los Angeles using historical LAPD crime data. 
By applying machine learning techniques and spatial analysis, the model predicts high-risk areas to support data-driven public safety decisions.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify crime-prone locations (hotspots)
- Analyze crime patterns based on time and location
- Provide actionable insights for security planning and community safety

## 🧠 Techniques Used
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Machine Learning Models for Hotspot Detection
- Data Visualization (Heatmaps & Graphs)

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Output
- Identified high-risk crime zones
- Visual crime hotspot maps
- Model performance evaluation

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Real-time crime prediction
- Deep learning-based spatial models
- Deployment as a web dashboard
